I have too much going on in December 2019 to be able to participate in real time. Besides, I can't imagine I'd have any hope of showing up on the leader board. I'm not fast. In spite of all that, I love playing along in my own good time. The problems are clever and fun, plus it's a great way for me to try to improve my Python skills since I rarely get to use it otherwise.
