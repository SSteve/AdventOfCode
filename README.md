I discovered Advent of Code in January 2019. I think it was through [PyCoder’s Weekly](https://pycoders.com).

I have too much going on in December 2019 to be able to participate in real time. Besides, I can't imagine I'd have any hope of showing up on the leader board. I'm not fast. In spite of all that, I love playing along in my own good time. The problems are clever and fun, plus it's a great way for me to try to improve my Python skills since I rarely get to use it otherwise.

I copied the layout of the repository and structure of the READMEs from [Kate Miháliková](https://github.com/katemihalikova/advent-of-code) whose link I followed from a [few](https://adventofcode.com/2019/leaderboard/day/2) [days](https://adventofcode.com/2019/leaderboard/day/3) [of](https://adventofcode.com/2019/leaderboard/day/4) the Advent of Code 2019 leaderboard.
